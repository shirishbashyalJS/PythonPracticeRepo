# Write a program that asks the user to enter names until he/she enters an
#  empty string. After each name is read the program either prints out New
#  name or Existing name depending on whether the name was entered for the
#  first time. Finally, the program lists out the input names one by one,
#  one below another in any order. Use the set data structure to store the
#  names.

names = set()
while True:
    name = input("Enter Name: ")
    if(name == ""):
        break
    if name in names:
        print("Existing Name.")
    else:
        print("New name.")
        names.add(name)

print("\nThe names are: ")
for name in names:
    print(name)
