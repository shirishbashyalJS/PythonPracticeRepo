# Write a program that asks the user to enter the names of five cities one by on (use a for loop for reading the names) and stores them into a list structure. Finally, the program prints out the names of the cities one by one, one city per line, in the same order they were read as input. Use a for loop for asking the names and a for/in loop to iterate through the list.
cities = []
for i in range(5):
    city = input(f"Enter city number {i+1}: ")
    cities.append(city)

for city in cities:
    print(city)
